The Neo4j GraphQL Library enables developers to build GraphQL APIs backed by Neo4j. It translates GraphQL to Cypher and allows for inclusion of Cypher in GraphQL through the use of the [`@cypher` GraphQL schema directive](https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/type-definitions/cypher/).

## Overview

The primary goal of the Neo4j GraphQL Library is to make it as easy as possible to build powerful GraphQL APIs that leverage the Neo4j graph database.

### Goals

- Improve developer productivity for building GraphQL APIs by generating a full GraphQL API from type definitions.
- Auto-generated resolvers by translating GraphQL to Cypher means developers don't need to write data fetching logic or GraphQL resolver functions.
- Exposing Cypher through GraphQL for adding custom logic with the power of Cypher.
- Define complex authorization rules using GraphQL schema directives.

## Other Neo4j GraphQL Integrations

The following Neo4j GraphQL integrations are not officially supported but are included here for reference:

* [neo4j-graphql-java](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-java) - Similar feature set as the official Neo4j GraphQL Library, but for Java / JVM GraphQL implementations
* [Neo4j GraphQL Database Plugin (*no longer maintained*)](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql) - a plugin for Neo4j that serves a GraphQL endpoint
* [neo4j-graphql.js (*no longer maintained*)](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js) - An initial Neo4j GraphQL integration for Node.js GraphQL implementations from [Neo4j Labs](https://neo4j.com/labs/). This project has been graduated into the official Neo4j GraphQL Library and is no longer maintained.
