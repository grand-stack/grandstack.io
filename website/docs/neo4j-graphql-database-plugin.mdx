This is a GraphQL-Endpoint extension for Neo4j and is part of GRANDstack.

_This readme assumes you are somewhat familiar with [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) and minimally with [Cypher](http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher)._

Based on your _GraphQL schema_, it translates GraphQL _Queries_ and _Mutations_ into Cypher statements and executes them on Neo4j.

It offers both an _HTTP API_, as well as, Neo4j Cypher _Procedures_ to execute and manage your GraphQL API.

## Installation

Download and install [Neo4j Desktop](http://neo4j.com/download).

Neo4j Desktop provides a quick install button for _neo4j-graphql_.

After creating your database you can find it under "Manage" in the "Plugins" tab for a single click install.

### Use with neo4j-graphql-cli

This extension is utilized, when you use [neo4j-graphql-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-cli).

This tool

1. launches a [Neo4j Sandbox](https://neo4j.com/sandbox) with your GraphQL schema
2. provides the `/graphql/` endpoint,
3. a Neo4j server,
4. an hosted GraphiQL for it.

```shell
npm install -g neo4j-graphql-cli
neo4j-graphql movies-schema.graphql
```

## Quickstart

To generate some graph data in Neo4j just run [`:play movie graph`](http://localhost:7474/browser?cmd=play&arg=movie%20graph) in your Neo4j Browser.

### GraphiQL

The best tool to use is [GraphiQL](https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql) the GraphQL UI. Get and install it.

Enter your GraphQL URL, like `http://localhost:7474/graphql/` (_note the trailing slash_).

If your Neo4j Server runs with _authentication enabled_, add the appropriate Basic-Auth ([base64 encoded](https://www.base64encode.org/)) `username:password` header in the "Edit HTTP Headers" screen.

.Command to generate the `Authorization` header value.

```shell
echo "Basic $(echo -n "neo4j:<password>" | base64)"
```

### Uploading a GraphQL Schema

Here is a small example schema for the movie data.
Just a Movie with actors, and a Person with movies.

Simple properties are mapped directly while the relationships are mapped to fields `movies` and `actors`

_Movies Schema_

```graphql
type Movie {
  title: String!
  released: Int
  actors: [Person] @relation(name: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
}
type Person {
  name: String!
  born: Int
  movies: [Movie] @relation(name: "ACTED_IN")
}
```

You can POST a GraphQL schema to the `/graphql/idl/` endpoint or run the `CALL graphql.idl('schema-text')` procedure.

The payload is parsed and stored in Neo4j and used subsequently as the backing GraphQL schema for validating and executing queries.

```cypher
CALL graphql.idl('
type Movie  {
  title: String!
  released: Int
  actors: [Person] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN",direction:IN)
}
type Person {
  name: String!
  born: Int
  movies: [Movie] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN")
}
')
```

You should then be able to see your schema in the _Docs_ section of GraphiQL.

This also gives you auto-completion, validation and hints when writing queries.

To visualize your GraphQL schema in Neo4j Browser use: `call graphql.schema()`.

### Auto-Generated Query Types

From that schema, the plugin automatically generate _Query Types_ for each of the declared types.

e.g. `Movie(title,released,first,offset,_id,orderBy, filter): [User]`

- Each field of the entity is available as _query argument_, with an equality check (plural for list-contains)
- We also provide a `filter` argument for more complex filtering with nested predicates, also for relation-fields (see [graphcool docs](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphql-api/query-api-nia9nushae))
- For ordered results there is a `orderBy` argument
- And `first`, `offset` allow for pagination

Now you can for instance run this query:

_Simple query example_

```graphql
{
  Person(name: "Kevin Bacon") {
    name
    born
    movies {
      title
      released
      tagline
    }
  }
}
```

<img alt="GraphQL query" src={useBaseUrl('assets/img/graphiql-query1.jpg')} />

_Advanced query example_

```graphql
query Nineties($released: Long, $letter: String)
{ Movie(released: $released,
        filter: {title_starts_with: $letter,
                 actors_some: { name_contains: $letter}}) {
    title
    released
    actors(first: 3) {
      name
      born
      movies(first: 1, orderBy: title_desc) {
        title
        released
      }
    }
  }
}

# query variables
{ "released":1995, "letter":"A"}
```

This query declares query name and parameters (first line), which are passed separately ("Query Parameters box") as JSON.

And get this result:

<img alt="GraphQL query" src={useBaseUrl('assets/img/graphiql-query2.jpg')} />

### Auto-Generated Mutations

Additionally _Mutations_ for each type are created, which return update statistics.

e.g. for the `Movie` type:

- `createMovie(title: ID!, released: Int) : String`
- `updateMovie(title: ID!, released: Int) : String`
- `deleteMovie(title: ID!) : String`

and for it's relationships:

- `addMovieActors(title: ID!, actors:[ID]!) : String`
- `deleteMovieActors(title: ID!, actors:[ID]!) : String`

Those mutations then allow you to create and update your data with GraphQL.

_Single Mutation_

```graphql
mutation {
  createPerson(name: "Chadwick Boseman", born: 1977)
}
```

_Mutation Result_

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createPerson": "Nodes created: 1\nProperties set: 2\nLabels added: 1\n"
  }
}
```

_Several Mutations at once_

```graphql
mutation {
  pp: createMovie(title: "Black Panther", released: 2018)
  lw: createPerson(name: "Letitia Wright", born: 1993)
  cast: addMovieActors(
    title: "Black Panther"
    actors: ["Chadwick Boseman", "Letitia Wright"]
  )
}
```

If the same mutations is called multiple times, you _need to use alias prefixes_ to avoid clashes in the returned data, which is keyed on mutation names.

<img alt="GraphQL mutation" src={useBaseUrl('assets/img/graphiql-mutation.jpg')} />

You can use those mutations also to [load data from CSV or JSON](https://medium.com/@mesirii/better-data-import-with-graphql-548084a35dfd).

### Directives

Directives like `@directiveName(param:value)` can be used to augment the schema with additional meta-information that we use for processing.

You have already seen the `@relation(name:"ACTED_IN", direction:IN)` directive to map entity references to graph relationships.

The `@cypher` directive is a powerful way of declaring _computed_ fields, query types and mutations with a Cypher statement.

_For instance, `directors`_

```graphql
type Movie {
  ...
  directors: [Person] @cypher(statement:"MATCH (this)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d) RETURN d")
}
```

_Register Top-Level Schema Types_

```graphql
schema {
  query: QueryType
  mutation: MutationType
}
```

_A custom query_

```graphql
type QueryType {
  ...
  coActors(name:ID!): [Person] @cypher(statement:"MATCH (p:Person {name:$name})-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(co) RETURN distinct co")
}
```

_A custom mutation_

```graphql
type MutationType {
  ...
  rateMovie(user:ID!, movie:ID!, rating:Int!): Int
  @cypher(statement:"MATCH (p:Person {name:$user}),(m:Movie {title:$movie}) MERGE (p)-[r:RATED]->(m) SET r.rating=$rating RETURN r.rating")
}
```

_Full enhanced Schema_

```graphql
type Movie {
  title: String!
  released: Int
  actors: [Person] @relation(name: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN)
  directors: [Person]
    @cypher(statement: "MATCH (this)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d) RETURN d")
}
type Person {
  name: String!
  born: Int
  movies: [Movie] @relation(name: "ACTED_IN")
}
schema {
  query: QueryType
  mutation: MutationType
}
type QueryType {
  coActors(name: ID!): [Person]
    @cypher(
      statement: "MATCH (p:Person {name:$name})-[:ACTED_IN]->()<-[:ACTED_IN]-(co) RETURN distinct co"
    )
}
type MutationType {
  rateMovie(user: ID!, movie: ID!, rating: Int!): Int
    @cypher(
      statement: "MATCH (p:Person {name:$user}),(m:Movie {title:$movie}) MERGE (p)-[r:RATED]->(m) SET r.rating=$rating RETURN r.rating"
    )
}
```

### Procedures

This library also comes with Cypher Procedures to execute GraphQL from within Neo4j.

_Simple Procedure Query_

```cypher
CALL graphql.query('{ Person(born: 1961) { name, born } }')
```

_Advanced Procedure Query with parameters and post-processing_

```cypher
WITH 'query ($year:Long,$limit:Int) { Movie(released: $year, first:$limit) { title, actors {name} } }' as query

CALL graphql.query(query,{year:1995,limit:5}) YIELD result

UNWIND result.Movie as movie
RETURN movie.title, [a IN movie.actors | a.name] as actors
```

<img alt="GraphQL execute" src={useBaseUrl('assets/img/graphql.execute.jpg')} />

_Update with Mutation_

```cypher
CALL graphql.execute('mutation { createMovie(title:"The Shape of Water", released:2018)}')
```

### Procedures

You can even visualize remote graphql schemas, e.g. here from the [GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/).
Make sure to generate the [Personal Access Token](https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/forming-calls/#authenticating-with-graphql) to use in your account settings.

```cypher
call graphql.introspect("https://api.github.com/graphql",{Authorization:"bearer d8xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"})
```
