A `filter` argument is added to field arguments, as well as input types used to support them.

> Filtering is currently supported for scalar fields, enums, `@relation` fields and types. Filtering on `@cypher` directive fields is not yet supported.

## `filter` Argument

The auto-generated `filter` argument is used to support complex filtering in queries. For example, to filter for Movies released before 1920:

```graphql
{
  Movie(filter: { year_lt: 1920 }) {
    title
    year
  }
}
```

<div className={styles.graphiqlcontainer}>
  <GraphiQLSnippet
    endpoint="https://movies.grandstack.io"
    query={`{
  Movie(filter: { year_lt: 1920 }) {
    title
    year
  }
}`}
  />
</div>

## Nested Filter

To filter based on the results of nested fields applied to the root, simply nest the filters used. For example, to search for movies whose title starts with "River" and has at least one actor whose name starts with "Brad":

```graphql
{
  Movie(
    filter: {
      title_starts_with: "River"
      actors_some: { name_contains: "Brad" }
    }
  ) {
    title
  }
}
```

<div className={styles.graphiqlcontainer}>
  <GraphiQLSnippet
    endpoint="https://movies.grandstack.io"
    query={`{
  Movie(
    filter: {
      title_starts_with: "River"
      actors_some: { name_contains: "Brad" }
    }
  ) {
    title
  }
}`}
  />
</div>

## Logical Operators: `AND`, `OR`

Filters can be wrapped in logical operations `AND` and `OR`. For example, to find movies that were released before 1920 or have a title that contains "River Runs":

```graphql
{
  Movie(filter: { OR: [{ year_lt: 1920 }, { title_contains: "River Runs" }] }) {
    title
    year
  }
}
```

<div className={styles.graphiqlcontainer}>
  <GraphiQLSnippet
    endpoint="https://movies.grandstack.io"
    query={`{
  Movie(filter: { OR: [{ year_lt: 1920 }, { title_contains: "River Runs" }] }) {
    title
    year
  }
}`}
  />
</div>

These logical operators can be nested as well. For example, find movies that there were released before 1920 or have a title that contains "River" and belong to the genre "Drama":

```graphql
{
  Movie(
    filter: {
      OR: [
        { year_lt: 1920 }
        {
          AND: [{ title_contains: "River" }, { genres_some: { name: "Drama" } }]
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    title
    year
    genres {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

<div className={styles.graphiqlcontainer}>
  <GraphiQLSnippet
    endpoint="https://movies.grandstack.io"
    query={`{
  Movie(
    filter: {
      OR: [
        { year_lt: 1920 }
        {
          AND: [{ title_contains: "River" }, { genres_some: { name: "Drama" } }]
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    title
    year
    genres {
      name
    }
  }
}`}
  />
</div>

## Regular Expressions: `regexp`

The Cypher [regular expression](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/where/#query-where-regex) filter is generated for `ID` and `String` type fields. The value provided should follow the [Java syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) for regular expressions.

For example, to find movies where the `title` property has the value `river` (case-insensitive):

```graphql
{
  Movie(filter: {
    title_regexp: "(?i)river.*"
  }) {
    title
    year
  }
}
```

<div className={styles.graphiqlcontainer}>
  <GraphiQLSnippet
    endpoint="https://movies.grandstack.io"
    query={`{
  Movie(filter: {
    title_regexp: "(?i)river.*"
  }) {
    title
    year
  }
}`}
  />
</div>

## Filtering In Selections

Filters can be used in not only the root query argument, but also throughout the selection set. For example, search for all movies that contain the string "River", and when returning the genres of the these movies only return genres with the name "Drama":

```graphql
{
  Movie(filter: { title_contains: "River" }) {
    title
    genres(filter: { name: "Drama" }) {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

<div className={styles.graphiqlcontainer}>
  <GraphiQLSnippet
    endpoint="https://movies.grandstack.io"
    query={`{
  Movie(filter: { title_contains: "River" }) {
    title
    genres(filter: { name: "Drama" }) {
      name
    }
  }
}`}
  />
</div>

## DateTime Filtering

Filtering can be applied to GraphQL temporal fields, using the temporal input types described in the [Temporal Types (DateTime) section](graphql-temporal-types-datetime.mdx#using-temporal-fields-in-mutations). For example, filter for reviews created before January 1, 2015:

```graphql
{
  User(first: 1) {
    rated(filter: { created_lt: { year: 2015, month: 1, day: 1 } }) {
      rating
      created {
        formatted
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<div className={styles.graphiqlcontainer}>
  <GraphiQLSnippet
    endpoint="https://movies.grandstack.io"
    query={`{
  User(first: 1) {
    rated(filter: {created_lt: {year: 2015, month: 1, day: 1}}) {
      rating
      created {
        formatted
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  />
</div>

## Spatial Filtering

When querying using point data, often we want to find things that are close to other things. For example, what businesses are within 1.5km of me? For example:

<div className={styles.graphiqlcontainer}>
  <GraphiQLSnippet
    endpoint="https://businessreviews.grandstack.io"
    query={`{
  Business(
    filter: {
      location_distance_lt: {
        point: { latitude: 46.859924, longitude: -113.985402 }
        distance: 1500
      }
    }
  ) {
    name
    location {
      latitude
      longitude
    }
  }
}`}
  />
</div>


For points using the Geographic coordinate reference system (latitude and longitude) `distance` is measured in meters.

## Filter Criteria

The filter criteria available depends on the type of the field and are added to the generated input type prefixed by the name of the field and suffixed with the criteria. For example, given the following type definitions:

```graphql
enum RATING {
  G
  PG
  PG13
  R
}

type Movie {
  movieId: ID!
  title: String
  year: Int
  rating: RATING
  available: Boolean
  actors: [Actor] @relation(name: "ACTED_IN", direction: "IN")
  reviews: [UserReview]
}

type Actor {
  name: String
}

type User {
  name: String
  rated: UserReview
}

type UserReview @relation(name: "RATED") {
  from: User
  to: Movie
  rating: Float
  createdAt: DateTime
}

type Business {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  location: Point
}
```

the following filtering criteria is available, through the generated `filter` input type.

_This table shows the fields available on the generated `filter` input type, and a brief explanation of each filter criteria._
